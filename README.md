# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms-Practice

Most of the exercises in this activity are credited to
Colt Steele's #JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
Masterclass# course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/share/100pDeBUYceV1WR3w=/)

Other activities and problems will be added as I come 
across them from other code practice websites.

Each script file should have:

- Description of the problem
- Potential test cases
- At least one working solution
- Running test cases which should console.log true
